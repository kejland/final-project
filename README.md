# Final Project: Memory Game

For my final project, I buit a card memory game.

## How to Play:

* Click the "Start Game!" Button to play
* The game will start by showing the placement of the cards
* You will have 5 seconds to remember the card placements before they flip back
* Click on one card to flip open
* Try to find the matching card
* If the cards don't match, they will flip back automatically
* If the cards do match, they will do a little dance and disappear
* If you want to restart the game while playing or after completing, click the "Shuffle Again!" button


## Special Features!:
1. Player will need to flip and match the cards
2. Matching cards will dance and disappear
3. Incorrect cards will automatically flip back
4. Player can shuffle and randomise the card placements by clicking "Shuffle Again!"

## Bonus!
(forgot to add):
* Cards get larger when hovered over
